                    <p>In order to be successful in online selling, you need to identify products that are in high
                        demand and hard to purchase
                        locally, but instead are bought online. You can perform an online market research using Google
                        Keyword Tool to find out
                        how many people looked up for a specific product online. Also, you can look at the completed
                        listings on eBay and search
                        for most popular items that sell 60% and more. </p>

                        convenience that you can offer to the potential buyer.</p>
                    <p>You can visit other eCommerce websites from the same niche, analyze their product selection,
                        prices and the consumer
                        buying process on their website. This way you will find valuable information on shortcomings in
                        their supply or customer
                        online experience that you can use and achieve competitive advantage. This research can also
