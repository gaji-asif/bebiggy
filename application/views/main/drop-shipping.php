            <p class="cg p-highlight drop_shipping_para_a">Drop shipping is a form of eCommerce online store where a store doesn't keep
                the products it sells in stock. Instead, when a store sells a product (at retail price), it
                purchases the item from a third party (at wholesale price) and a third party ships the product
                directly to the customer under the store's trademark.

                        much more convenient for retailers as it saves you money you'd need to invest in keeping the
                        inventory as well as time and efforts to ship the goods and deal with customer service.</p>

                        inventory until a customer places an order and pay for it. This form of selling has its
                        advantages as the store can buy multiple items or specific items in bulk to get discounts
                        from the supplier. However, it also requires the retailer to acquire more physical space to
                        store in a warehouse and make regular payments in the context of lighting, manpower, etc.
                        and even make huge investment in the products upfront that is later covered by the purchase
                        cost by products.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">In a dropshipping retail model, the retailer instead showcases products of
                        suppliers and takes orders from customers. Thereafter, details of the order are forwarded to
                        the drop shipping supplier after a customer places an order and pays for it. The retailer
                        makes a wholesale and agreed payment to the supplier and keeps the difference between the
                        price paid by the customer to him and the price paid to the supplier. The supplier is
                        responsible for packaging and shipping of the order and this reduces storage requirements
                        for the retailers besides requiring less upfront capital.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">Here is an example of a normal retail business model without a dropshipper: </p>
                    <p class="py-2">You routinely make orders for products from a supplier with a predefined purpose
                        of maintaining the inventory on hand. This is usually done in Minimum Order Quantities
                        (MOQs) for getting wholesale prices.
                        You pay for warehousing and store products until a customer places an order for them.
                        You are completely responsible for processing each and every order. Moreover, you have to
                        pack and ship the products to the customers yourself.
                        Here is an example of a retail business model with a dropshipper:</p>
                    <p class="py-2">A customer selects some products and places an order with you.<br>
                        Information about the order is passed on to the dropshipper.<br>
                        The dropshipper charges a wholesale and agreed price for the product sold on receipt of an
                        order from you.<br>
                        The dropshipper then directly pack and ship the goods on your behalf to the customer.<br>
                        In other words, dropshipping is the process of showcasing products of suppliers on your web
                        store and selling them without actually handling dropshipping order fulfillment and
                        shipping. One of the most amazing components of dropshipping is that you, as a retailer,
                        don't have to ever pay for the product until a payment for it has been made to you by the
                        customer. This distinctive advantage of dropshipping makes it ideal for people who don't
                        want to take any kind of risk to buy products that would not sell. Not only this, the low
                        barrier to entry facilitated by dropshipping allows beginners to the world of dropshipping
                        and even owners of existing businesses to pick a specific niche and run their
                        dropshipping-based eCommerce store at their own terms and conditions.</p>

                </div>
                <div class="py-2">
                    <p class="py-2">Dropshipping frees your business from the time, monetary, and labor costs of manufacturing, warehousing, packaging, and shipping products yourself.
                    </p>

                    <p class="py-2"> One of the most noteworthy advantages of dropshipping is that you can offer a wide and rich range of products on your dropshipping web store that would have been otherwise impossible or too costly to pack and ship because of the limitations of your eCommerce dropshipping store (such as perishable or extremely large products). With dropshipping, you can be located anywhere in the world and the products sold by you will still reach your customers!</p>

                     <p class="py-2">Another advantage of dropshipping is that you get enough to promote your web store on a wide range of marketing channels like Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram. You are relieved from the complicated tasks of packaging, shipping, and order fulfillment (that are huge logistical headaches) as all these tasks are handled entirely by the dropshipper.</p>
                     <p class="py-2">
                        In short, dropshipping allows you to outsource packaging, shipping, and order fulfillment to the dropshipper. The best part is that since dropshippers are usually large businesses that deal with many orders every day, they have access to negotiated shipping rates that are comparatively lower than the ones that your small or medium business can possibly get on its own. Moreover, dropshipping can also be useful to minimize losses from damaged products as product shipments follow a more direct and precise route from the warehouse to the customer.
                     </p>
                     <p class="py-2">
                        In addition to eliminating the requirement for the storage of physical inventory, dropshipping ensures that your web store never has to worry about shortages or overstock on your end. It also ensures that your eCommerce dropshipping web store is not susceptible to the possible risk of shifting trends that may result in specific products to suddenly fall out or in favor. Furthermore, most dropshippers offer the facility to expand your current selection to new products, from extremely popular to niche items and classic sellers. Dropshipping organically promotes scalability between the flexibility to select the location of your web store and the ability to expand.

                 <div class="py-2">
                    <p class="py-2">
                        The biggest advantage of dropshipping is that you, as the retailer, only purchase the product when it is already purchased by the customer. This means that you get the wonderful opportunity to invest the “saved” resources (from wholesale pricing and no warehousing expenses) on other critical aspects of running your web store such as buying more paid online advertising or using Pay-per-click marketing
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        This also eliminates the risk of purchasing products that may or may not sell. By doing this, dropshipping brings down the product upfront costs to zero. All in all, dropshipping is an amazing business opportunity for businesses that want to stick to a moderate and lean cost structure or want to sell products online without inventory.
                    </p>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        Secondly, dropshipping allows you to test out new ideas or products to increase your chances of success with running a profitable eCommerce store. If you have been wondering which style of footwear or baseball bats would went on to become bestsellers on your store, you can trust dropshipping to help you perform real-time and precise marketing testing in the most affordable and easiest ways and all this without having to make huge investments in testing the market pre-launch. This gives you a great option to switch your product selection and marketing strategies until you manage to hit on the magical formula that works for your dropshipping business.
