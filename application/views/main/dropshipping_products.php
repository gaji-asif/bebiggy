                </div>
                <div class="py-2">
                    <p class="py-2">There are two types of winning products:</p>
                    <ul type="number" class="">
                        <li>Evergreen Products</li>
                        <li>Winning Products</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="py-2"><b>Evergreen products</b> are items that might not ever trend big or currently not trending but there is always a continuous stream of customers who are looking to purchase them every now and then. The complicated thing is that you may not ever be actually able to scale these products to thousands of dollars in a day but you'll be able to generate a steady profit of say $1,000 every month.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">The more evergreen products you can discover, the longer you can expect to run a profitable store producing profits year after year.</p>
                    <p class="py-2"><b>Trending products</b> are items that are characterized by an influx of customers who are looking to buy something for a specific season, reason, event, fad, or movement. These products may not last forever as the evergreen products but they can surely help you make thousands of dollars within in a short amount of time.</p>

                <div class="py-2">
                    <p class="py-2">Most eCommerce stores have their bestseller lists and they are unarguably wonderful for customers who are looking to buy the best products. But the bestseller lists are nothing short of a freaking goldmine for online retailers. Somehow, budding and new entrepreneurs don’t exploit them enough.</p>
                    <p class="py-2">You may have heard the whispers that dropshipping is not worthwhile as everyone will be selling the same products as you. But, you should try to have a close look at this with a glass half full approach. If everyone is able to make money selling the same products, you can sell it too and you can surely sell winning products if you know what their bestsellers are.

                </div>
                <div class="py-2">
                    <p class="py-2">It is important for you to carefully identify and add impulse buy products to your dropshipping web store. For this, you have to keep your eyes open for them while looking through bestseller lists on websites like Amazon and Wish. Some possible signs of impulse buy products include things such as:</p>
                    <ul class="">
                        <li>Vibrant and colorful (or visually stands out when scrolling);</li>
                        <li>Elicits an emotional or touching reaction ("I love this", "He or she will just love this", "This is so adorable", or "I need this");</li>
                        <li>Different style or design from anything you have ever seen.</li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
                <div class="py-2">
                    <p class="py-2">Most of your competitors have their bestseller lists. You should check them out regularly and you'll be able to identify within their bestselling products by evaluating their product collections. The more closely you look web stores of competitors, the more you will find connections and patterns among top brands. Thereafter, you can simply incorporate these patterns as you start building your product collection.

                </div>
                <div class="py-2">
                    <p class="py-2">There are many factors that ensure the winning products of your web store have the best chances of success.</p>
                    <ul class="">
                        <li>Your web store should convert;</li>
                        <li>The product should not be easily available (i.e. not in retail stores);</li>
                        <li>Your advertisements should target and attract the right audience at the right time and at the right place;</li>
                        <li>Your website should convince pre-buyers to buy right now before going off and doing research.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="py-2">
                        The single-most reason differentiating successful stores from the not-so-successful stores is research. Of course, it is too easy to get carried away and end up adding random products onto your store for the simple reason that they look good. But if your goal is to own and run a store that sells top performing products -- the Winning Products -- your process just cannot be random. It must only be strategic. In other words, you should not at all be afraid to do some good homework, find out what people are talking about, and do some competitor research. You will surely inch closer to find high-performing winning products for your store by paying close attention to competitors and high-performing advertisements.
