                <p class="cg p-highlight drop_shipping_para_a">Drop shipping is a form of eCommerce online store where a store doesn’t
                    keep the products it sells in stock. Instead,
                    when a store sells a product (at retail price), it purchases the item from a third party (at
                    wholesale price) and a
                    third party ships the product directly to the customer under the store’s trademark.</p>

                            much more convenient for retailers as it saves you money you’d need to invest in keeping the
                            inventory as well as time and efforts to ship the goods and deal with customer service.</p>

                            <li>You receive the order and either manually or automatically you forward the order to the
                                product supplier and make a payment for the product at the wholesale price.</li>
                            <li>Product supplier picks up the order, processes it, packs the product and ships it to the
